# Welcome to the coding task :)

If something is not clear, or you need help - just ask :) Nobody knows everything!

1. Read the task
2. Create a project (Vue or vanilla)
3. Please implement the project according to your own best standards,
    - Tests, TDD
    - Code readability and code style
    - Structure / architecture
    - Refactoring
4. Layout - bootstrap or a plain design is enough
5. Commit frequently
6. Provide an overview for which points you would improve if you had more time to work on the project
7. Write code that is suitable for production
8. Submit via codesubmit

## Scenario - Weathermap api client

Your app should be a client for the [Open Weather Map API](http://openweathermap.org/API#weather)

## Requested Features

- Display the weather at random geographic coordinates
- Have a form to query and display the weather at a specific city
    - Optional: implement a caching mechanism
- Gracefully handle the case where the location could not be found (display the information to the user)

Have fun!

1) install vue and boiler plate code and bootstrap on it.
2) add whether api in system and test call of api and read documentation of api how we can use it.
3) use Store to call api. (check local machine code).
4) display whether of random cities.
5) Add form to check particular city whether and have to add loader on it.
6) create component for whether cards.
7) Location not found page has to implement.
8) Try to implement chaching in local machine.
